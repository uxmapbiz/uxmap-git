Chronological changelog of project decisions and feature changes.

---
## 2025-07-19 ‚Äì Day 6

- Completed MVP architecture for journey map: dashboard layout now manages state and navigation for website analysis.
- Updated max token, truncation to 15,000 input and 1,000 for output (GPT 3.5 turbo limits)
- Refactored navigation to use `DashboardPage` with sidebar (`SideNav`) and new Home, Journey Map, and Results pages.
- Updated all screens to use parent-passed props: `websiteUrl` and `onWebsiteSubmitted`.
- Implemented recursive menu tree in `JourneyMapPage` using `ExpansionTile`.
- Result page now fetches and displays analysis for the current website.


## 2025-07-12 ‚Äì Day 5

- Integrated Firebase Firestore for saving and retrieving UX analysis results.
- Refactored backend (`server.py`) to:
    - Retrieve past analysis results for each website and use as context in AI analysis.
    - Save new AI analysis results to Firestore only when API is called (removed static test entry).
- Set up secure deployment on Render using environment variables for Firebase credentials.
- Fixed frontend (Flutter) UI:
    - Sidebar now light green, results area and header are white.
    - ‚ÄúGo Home‚Äù button removed from navigation.
    - Added ‚ÄúCopy to Clipboard‚Äù button for AI analysis result.
    - Removed extra duplicate text at bottom of results.
- Confirmed data is being saved and retrieved correctly from both frontend and backend.
- Improved `.gitignore` to protect sensitive keys and build artifacts.
- Addressed and resolved minor build and UI bugs (e.g., AppBar color, Dart syntax, and hot reload speed).



## 2025-06-28 ‚Äì Day 4

- Refactored frontend UI to use side navigation for analysis results; removed raw element list from user view
- Added loading spinner to improve user feedback during analysis requests
- Backend now returns structured JSON including `ux_score`, summary, and reason
- Updated backend prompt to instruct AI to return a score and reason in JSON format
- Implemented JSON parsing logic in backend; fixed indentation and error handling
- Frontend now displays UX score, summary, and reason in the Results tab
- Cleaned up `.gitignore` and removed tracked build/artifact folders from GitHub
- Debugged navigation, API, and deployment issues; confirmed end-to-end flow is working
- Pushed all updated code to GitHub for both frontend and backend


## 2025-06-25 ‚Äì Day 3 Backend Security & API Refactor
- Moved OpenAI API key and all OpenAI requests from Flutter frontend to backend (`server.py`) for improved security
- Added `/analyze` endpoint to Flask backend to perform crawling, clickable element extraction, and AI UX analysis
- Updated requirements.txt to include all necessary dependencies for cloud deployment (e.g., `bs4`)
- Fixed Render deploy failures caused by missing modules
- Verified that frontend now communicates only with the backend; no API keys or HTML parsing in Dart code
- Backend API returns both clickable elements and UX analysis as JSON for use in the Flutter app


## 2025-06-20 ‚Äì Day 2
- Started project documentation
- Agreed to structure `/docs/` folder with `ideas.md` and `updates.md`
- Reconfirmed Option 1: GitHub-based ideation + versioning
- Next step: Initialize Flutter project and basic UI

---

## 2025-06-19 ‚Äì Day 1
- Project concept discussed
- Agreed to build in Flutter (multi-platform)
- Goal: Website UX analyzer + journey mapper
